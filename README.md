This is a template for parts of my website that I'm organizing into separate
git repos. Why? Because I want to work with Obsidian but don't want to clutter
up the main website repo's build system, and I want something modular.

Why not use Obsidian Publish? Well, too late for that, I guess!

Feel free to check out how the `example.md` is rendered
[here](https://n3rdium.dev/mdsite-template-test/example.html). The link may not
work if the 
[overhaul branch](https://github.com/N3RDIUM/n3rdium.dev/tree/overhaul) isn't
merged yet.
